\usage{
Read.IC.info.BADM(lat, long)
}
\arguments{
\item{lat}{numeric latitude}

\item{long}{numeric longitude}
}
\value{
a datframe with 8 columns of Site, Variable, Date, Organ, PlantWIni (Initial plant biomass, type of biomass can be found in the Var and Organ), SoilIni (which shows the initial soil C), LitterIni, RootIni.
}
\description{
This function returns a dataframe of plant biomass, root and soil carbon for a lat and long coordinates.
This function first finds the level1 and level2 ecoregions  for the given coordinates, and then tries to dplyr::filter BADM database for those eco-region. 
If no data found in the BADM database for the given lat/longs eco-regions, then all the data in the database will be used to return the initial condition.
All the variables are also converted to kg/m^2.
