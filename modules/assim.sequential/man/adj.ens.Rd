\usage{
adj.ens(Pf, X, X.new, mu.f, mu.a, Pa, processvar)
}
\arguments{
\item{Pf}{A cov matrix of forecast state variables.}

\item{X}{Dataframe or matrix of forecast state variables for different ensembles.}

\item{mu.f}{A vector with forecast mean estimates of state variables.}

\item{mu.a}{A vector with analysis mean estimates of state variables.}

\item{Pa}{The state estimate cov matrix of analysis.}

\item{processvar}{Boolean flag for indicating if process variance is used in the analysis. If TRUE then X.new needs to be supplied.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of adjusted analysis mean estimates of state variables.
}
\description{
This functions gives weights to different ensemble members based on their likelihood during the analysis step. Then it adjusts the analysis mean estimates of state variables based on the estimated weights.
