## PEcAn Virtual Machine {#pecanvm}

The PEcAn virtual machine consists of all of PEcAn pre-compiled within a Linux operating system and saved in a "virtual machine" (VM). Virtual machines allow for running consistent set-ups without worrying about differences between operating systems, library dependencies, compiling the code, etc.

1. **Install VirtualBox** This is the software that runs the virtual machine. You can find the download link and instructions at [http://www.virtualbox.org](http://www.virtualbox.org). *NOTE: On Windows you may see a warning about Logo testing, it is okay to ignore the warning.*
  
2. **Download the PEcAn VM** You can find the download link at [http://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/projects/artifacts.php?key=PECAN](http://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/projects/artifacts.php?key=PECAN), under the "**Files**" header. Click the ".ova" file to begin the download. Note that the file is ~7 GB, so this download can take several minutes to hours depending on your connection speed. Also, the VM requires >4 GB of RAM to operate correctly. Please check current usage of RAM and shutdown processes as needed.

3. **Import the VM** Once the download is complete, open VirtualBox. In the VirtualBox menus, go to "File" → "Import Appliance" and locate the downloaded ".ova" file. 


For Virtualbox version 5.x: In the Appliance Import Settings, make sure you select "Reinitialize the MAC address of all network cards" (picture below). This is not selected by default and can result in networking issues since multiple machines might claim to have the same network MAC Address. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/pic1.jpg"))
```

For Virtualbox versions starting with 6.0, there is a slightly different interface (see figure). Select "Generate new MAC addresses for all network adapters" from the MAC Address Policy:
  
  ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/pic1v2.png"))
```

NOTE: If you experience network connection difficulties in the VM with this enabled, try re-importing the VM without this setting selected). 

Finally, click "Import" to build the Virtual Machine from its image.

4. **Launch PEcAn** Double click the icon for the PEcAn VM. A terminal window will pop up showing the machine booting up which may take a minute. It is done booting when you get to the `pecan login:` prompt. You do not need to login as the VM behaves like a server that we will be accessing through you web browser. Feel free to minimize the VM window.

* If you _do_ want to login to the VM, the credentials are as follows: `username: carya`, `password: illinois` (after the pecan tree, [Carya illinoinensis][pecan-wikipedia]).

5. **Open the PEcAn web interface** With the VM running in the background, open any web browser on the same machine and navigate to `localhost:6480/pecan/` to start the PEcAn workflow. (NOTE: The trailing backslash may be necessary depending on your browser)

* To ssh into the VM, open up a terminal on your machine and execute `ssh -l carya -p 6422 localhost`. Username and password are the same as when you log into the machine.

### Maintaining your PEcAn VM

The PEcAn VM is distributed with specific versions of PEcAn compiled. You do not need to constatnly download the VM in order to update your code and verion of BETY. To update and maintain your code you can follow these steps:

### Using Amazon Web Services (AWS) {#awsvm}

Login to [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://console.aws.amazon.com/) and select the EC2 Dashboard. If this is your first time using AWS you will need to set up an account before you are able to access the EC2 Dashboard. Important: You will need a credit card number and access to a phone to be able to verify AWS account registration. AWS is free for one year.

1.  Choose AMI
+ On the top right next to your name, make sure the location setting is on U.S. East (N. Virginia), not U.S. West (Oregon)
+	On the left click, click on EC2 (Virtual servers), then click on “AMIs”, also on the left
+	In the search window toggle to change “Owned by me” to “Public images”
+	Type “pecan” into the search window
+	Click on the toggle button on the left next to PEcAn1.4.6
+	Click on the “Launch” button at the top
2.	Choose an Instance Type
+	Select what type of machine you want to run. For this demo the default, t2.micro, will be adequate. Be aware that different machine types incur very different costs, from 1.3 cents/hour to over \$5/hr https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/   
  + Select t2.micro, then click “Next: Configure Instance Details”
3.	Configure Instance Details
+	The defaults are OK. Click “Next: Add Storage”
4.	Add Storage
+	The defaults are OK. Click “Next: Tag Instance”
5.	Tag Instance
+	You can name your instance if you want. Click “Next: Configure Security Group”
6.	Configure Security Group
+	You will need to add two new rules:
  + Click “Add Rule” then select “HTTP” from the pull down menu. This rule allows you to access the webserver on PEcAn.
+	Click “Add Rule”, leave the pull down on “Custom TCP Rule”, and then change the Port Range from 0 to 8787. Set “Source” to Anywhere. This rule allows you to access RStudio Server on PEcAn.
+	Click “Review and Launch”  . You will then see this pop-up:
  
  ```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/pic2.jpg"))
```    

Select the default drive volume type and click Next

7.  Review and Launch
+  Review the settings and then click “Launch”, which will pop up a select/create Key Pair window.
8.	Key Pair
+	Select “Create a new key pair” and give it a name. You won’t actually need this key unless you need to SSH into your PEcAn server, but AWS requires you to create one. Click on “Download Key Pair” then on “Launch Instances”. Next click on “View Instances” at the bottom of the following page.


```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/pic3.jpg"))
```

9.	Instances
+  You will see the status of your PEcAn VM, which will take a minute to boot up. Wait until the Instance State reads “running”. The most important piece of information here is the Public IP, which is the URL you will need in order to access your PEcAn instance from within your web browser (see Demo 1 below).
+  Be aware that it often takes ~1 hr for AWS instances to become fully operational, so if you get an error when you put the Public IP in you web browser, most of the time you just need to wait a bit longer.
Congratulations! You just started a PEcAn server in the “cloud”!
  
  10. When you are done using PEcAn, you will want to return to the “Instances” menu to turn off your VM.
+ To STOP the instance (which will turn the machine off but keep your work), select your PEcAn instance and click Actions > Instance state > Stop. Be aware that a stopped instance will still accrue a small storage cost on AWS. To restart this instance at any point in the future you do not want to repeat all the steps above, but instead you just need to select your instance and then click Actions > Instance state > Start
+	To TERMINATE the instance (which will DELETE your PEcAn machine), select your instance and click Actions > Instance state > Terminate. Terminated instances will not incur costs. In most cases you will also want to go to the Volumes menu and delete the storage associated with your PEcAn VM.Remember, AWS is free for one year, but will automatically charge a fee in second year if account is not cancelled.
