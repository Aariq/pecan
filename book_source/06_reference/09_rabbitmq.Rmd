# RabbitMQ {#rabbitmq}

This section provides additional details about how PEcAn uses RabbitMQ to manage communication between its Docker containers.

In PEcAn, we use the Python [`pika`](http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html) client to post and retrieve messages from RabbitMQ.
As such, every Docker container that communicates with RabbitMQ contains two Python scripts: `sender.py` and `reciever.py`.
Both are located in the `docker` directory in the PEcAn source code root.

## Producer -- `sender.py` {#rabbitmq-basics-sender}

The `sender.py` script is in charge of posting messages to RabbitMQ.
In the RabbitMQ documentation, it is known as a "producer".
It runs once for every message posted to RabbitMQ, and then immediately exits (unlike the `receiver.py`, which runs continuously -- see [below](#rabbitmq-basics-receiver)).

Its usage is as follows:

```bash
python3 sender.py <URI> <queue> <message>
```

The arguments are:

- `<URI>` -- The unique identifier of the RabbitMQ instance, similar to a URL.
The format is `amqp://username:password@host/vhost`.
By default, this is `amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq/%2F` (the `%2F` here is the hexadecimal encoding for the `/` character).

- `<queue>` -- The name of the queue on which to post the message.

- `<message>` -- The contents of the message to post, in JSON format.
A typical message posted by PEcAn looks like the following:
  
  ```json
  { "folder" : "/path/to/PEcAn_WORKFLOWID", "workflow" : "WORKFLOWID" }
  ```
  
The `PEcAn.remote::start_rabbitmq` function is a wrapper for this script that provides an easy way to post a `folder` message to RabbitMQ from R.

## Consumer -- `receiver.py` {#rabbitmq-basics-receiver}

Unlike `sender.py`, `receiver.py` runs like a daemon, constantly listening for messages.
In the RabbitMQ documentation, it is known as a "consumer".
In PEcAn, you can tell that it is ready to receive messages if the corresponding logs (e.g. `docker-compose logs executor`) show the following message:

```
[*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C.
```

Our `reciever` is configured by three environment variables:

- `RABBITMQ_URI` -- This defines the URI where RabbitMQ is running.
See corresponding argument in the [producer](#rabbitmq-basics-sender)

- `RABBITMQ_QUEUE` -- This is the name of the queue on which the consumer will listen for messages, just as in the [producer](#rabbitmq-basics-sender).

- `APPLICATION` -- This specifies the name (including the path) of the executable to run when receiving a message.
At the moment, it should be an executable that runs in the directory specified by the message's `folder` variable.
In the case of PEcAn models, this is usually `./job.sh`, such that the `folder` corresponds to the `run` directory associated with a particular `runID` (i.e. where the `job.sh` is located).
For the PEcAn workflow itself, this is set to `R CMD BATCH workflow.R`, such that the `folder` is the root directory of the workflow (in the `executor` Docker container, something like `/data/workflows/PEcAn_<workflowID>`).

## RabbitMQ and the PEcAn web interface {#rabbitmq-web}

RabbitMQ is configured by the following variables in `config.php`:

- `$rabbitmq_host` -- The RabbitMQ server hostname (default: `rabbitmq`, because that is the name of the `rabbitmq` service in `docker-compose.yml`)
- `$rabbitmq_port` -- The port on which RabbitMQ listens for messages (default: 5672)
- `$rabbitmq_vhost` -- The path of the RabbitMQ [Virtual Host](https://www.rabbitmq.com/vhosts.html) (default: `/`).
- `$rabbitmq_queue` -- The name of the RabbitMQ queue associated with the PEcAn workflow (default: `pecan`)
- `$rabbitmq_username` -- The RabbitMQ username (default: `guest`)
- `$rabbitmq_password` -- The RabbitMQ password (default: `guest`)

In addition, for running models via RabbitMQ, you will also need to add an entry like the following to the `config.php` `$hostlist`:

```php
$hostlist=array($fqdn => array("rabbitmq" => "amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq/%2F"), ...)
```

This will set the hostname to the name of the current machine (defined by the `$fqdn` variable earlier in the `config.php` file) to an array with one entry, whose key is `rabbitmq` and whose value is the RabbitMQ URI (`amqp://...`).

These values are converted into the appropriate entries in the `pecan.xml` in `web/04-runpecan.php`.

## RabbitMQ in the PEcAn XML {#rabbitmq-xml}

RabbitMQ is a special case of remote execution, so it is configured by the `host` node.
An example RabbitMQ configuration is as follows:

```xml
<host>
  <rabbitmq>
    <uri>amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq/%2F</uri>
	<queue>sipnet_136</queue>
  </rabbitmq>
</host>
```

Here, `uri` and `queue` have the same general meanings as described in ["producer"](#rabbitmq-basics-sender).
Note that `queue` here refers to the target model.
In PEcAn, RabbitMQ model queues are named as `MODELTYPE_REVISION`,
so the example above refers to the SIPNET model version 136.
Another example is `ED2_git`, referring to the latest `git` version of the ED2 model.

## RabbitMQ configuration in Dockerfiles {#rabbitmq-dockerfile}

As described in the ["consumer"](#rabbitmq-basics-receiver) section, our standard RabbitMQ receiver script is configured using three environment variables: `RABBITMQ_URI`, `RABBITMQ_QUEUE`, and `APPLICATION`.
Therefore, configuring a container to work with PEcAn's RabbitMQ instance requires setting these three variables in the Dockerfile using an [`ENV`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env) statement.

For example, this excerpt from `docker/base/Dockerfile.executor` (for the `pecan/executor` image responsible for the PEcAn workflow) sets these variables as follows:

```dockerfile
ENV RABBITMQ_URI="amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq/%2F" \
    RABBITMQ_QUEUE="pecan" \
    APPLICATION="R CMD BATCH workflow.R"
```

Similarly, this excerpt from `docker/models/Dockerfile.sipnet` (which builds the SIPNET model image) is a typical example for a model image.
Note the use of [`ARG`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg) here to specify a default version model version of 136 while allowing this to be configurable (via `--build-arg MODEL_VERSION=X`) at build time:

```dockerfile
ARG MODEL_VERSION=136

ENV APPLICATION="./job.sh" \
    MODEL_TYPE="SIPNET" \
    MODEL_VERSION="${MODEL_VERSION}" \
    RABBITMQ_QUEUE="${MODEL_TYPE}_${MODEL_VERSION}"
```
