    testthat (>= 3.0.0),
    vdiffr (>= 1.0.2)
X-Comment-Remotes:
    Installing vdiffr from GitHub because as of 2021-09-23, this is the
    easiest way to get version >= 1.0.2 onto Docker images that use older
    Rstudio Package Manager snapshots.
    When these are updated, OK to go back to installing vdiffr from CRAN.
