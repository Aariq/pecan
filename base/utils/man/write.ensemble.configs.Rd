\usage{
write.ensemble.configs(defaults, ensemble.samples, settings, model,
  clean = FALSE, write.to.db = TRUE, restart = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{defaults}{pft}

\item{ensemble.samples}{list of lists supplied by \link{get.ensemble.samples}}

\item{settings}{list of PEcAn settings}

\item{clean}{remove old output first?}

\item{restart}{In case this is a continuation of an old simulation. restart needs to be a list with name tags of runid, inputs, new.params (parameters), new.state (initial condition), ensemble.id (ensemble id), start.time and stop.time.See Details.}

\item{write.config}{a model-specific function to write config files, e.g. \link{write.config.ED}}
}
\value{
list, containing $runs = data frame of runids, $ensemble.id = the ensemble ID for these runs and $samples with ids and samples used for each tag.  Also writes sensitivity analysis configuration files as a side effect
}
\description{
Write ensemble config files
}
\details{
Writes config files for use in meta-analysis and returns a list of run ids.
Given a pft.xml object, a list of lists as supplied by get.sa.samples, 
a name to distinguish the output files, and the directory to place the files.

Resatrt functionality here is developed using model specific functions called write_restart.modelname . You need to make sure first that this function is already exsit for your dersired model.
new state is mainly a dataframe with a different column for different variables for n rows and n sample size. new.params also has similar structure to ensemble.samples which is sent as an argument.
