# PEcAn.remote 1.7.2.9000

* Removed dependency on `PEcAn.DB` by deleting function `remote.copy.update`,
  which was used in only one place and contained typos that guaranteed it could
  never have worked anywhere else.

# PEcAn.remote 1.7.1

* All changes in 1.7.1 and earlier were recorded in a single file for all of
  the PEcAn packages; please see
  https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/v1.7.1/CHANGELOG.md for details.
