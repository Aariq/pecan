Description: The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) is a scientific
    workflow management tool that is designed to simplify the management of
    model parameterization, execution, and analysis. The goal of PEcAn is to
    streamline the interaction between data and models, and to improve the
    efficacy of scientific investigation. This package provides functions to
    link the Community Terrestrial System Model, versions 5, to PEcAn. Will 
    support CLM 5, and will provide helper functions for PEcAn.ELM, PEcAn.CTSM_FATES,
    and PEcAn.ELM_FATES.
